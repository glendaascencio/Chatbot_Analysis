# GA Chatbot Analysis

Creating a comprehensive analysis of chatbots and building a predictive model. This will involve multiple components.

Now let me explain how this code works and how you can use it for chatbot analysis:

Data Structure and Preparation:

The code expects conversation data with user inputs, bot responses, and intents
We use tokenization to convert text into numerical sequences
The LabelEncoder converts intent labels into numerical values


Model Architecture:

Uses an LSTM-based deep learning model for intent prediction
Includes embedding layer to handle text data
Has two LSTM layers followed by dense layers for classification
Uses softmax activation for multi-class intent prediction


Analysis Components:

Interaction Analysis: Tracks metrics like total conversations, unique intents, message lengths
Performance Evaluation: Measures success rate, intent accuracy, user satisfaction
Response Time Analysis: Calculates average response times



To use this code with your own chatbot data:
pythonCopy# Load your data
conversations_df = pd.read_csv('your_chatbot_data.csv')

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = ChatbotAnalyzer()

# Prepare data and train model
X, y = analyzer.prepare_data(conversations_df)
model = analyzer.build_model(vocab_size, num_classes)

# Analyze interactions
analysis = analyzer.analyze_interactions(conversations_df)
For R analysis, I'll create a complementary script that focuses on visualization and statistical analysis:

The R code complements the Python analysis by providing:

Visualization capabilities for temporal patterns and intent distribution
Statistical analysis of chatbot performance
Pattern recognition in conversation flows

To make the most of this analysis system:

Data Collection:

Gather conversation logs with timestamps
Track user inputs and bot responses
Record intents and success metrics


Analysis Workflow:

Use Python for data preprocessing and model building
Use R for statistical analysis and visualization
Combine insights from both to improve the chatbot


Model Improvement:

Use the analysis results to identify areas for improvement
Retrain the model with new data periodically
Adjust the model architecture based on performance metrics
